// ─── Daily check-in: storage, orientation items and within-person trend ──────

//

// A once-a-day, roughly one-minute check that replaces the household-chore list

// in Secondary Care. Chores are a caregiving feature; this app is for early

// detection, and the earliest thing to go in Alzheimer's disease is memory for

// recent personal events. Asking for that every day is the only practical way

// to watch it change.

//

// Three parts, in this order:

//   1. Orientation  - what day of the week, which month (MMSE/MoCA time items).

//   2. Daily recall - "tell me about your day", scored by the backend for

//                     episodic detail (backend/daily_recall.py).

//   3. Informant    - one question for a family member, adapted from the AD8.

//

// The whole point is the trend. A single day says nothing: sleep, mood and how

// much actually happened all move these numbers. Everything below is therefore

// computed against the same person's own earlier check-ins, never against a

// population cut-off.
