/**
 * Ambient noise pre-flight
 * ========================
 * Measures the room before recording starts, so a screening is not attempted in
 * conditions that will corrupt it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every acoustic biomarker this app computes - pause structure, F0 variability,
 * jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio - degrades with background noise,
 * and Whisper's word timings degrade with it too. A screening recorded beside a
 * ceiling fan does not produce a slightly worse score; it produces a confidently
 * wrong one, because the noise floor raises measured silence thresholds and
 * lowers measured harmonicity in exactly the directions that mimic impairment.
 *
 * The honest response is to refuse before recording rather than to score badly
 * afterwards. This mirrors the sample-sufficiency gate in the backend: both
 * decline to produce a number rather than produce an unreliable one.
 *
 * CRITICAL: the measurement stream disables echoCancellation, noiseSuppression
 * and autoGainControl. The recording path deliberately enables them, but for
 * measurement they are fatal - the browser would suppress the very noise being
 * measured and report a quiet room in front of a running fan.
