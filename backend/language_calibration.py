SwarSanket Cross-Lingual Feature Calibration
============================================
Corrects the systematic bias introduced by scoring non-Chinese speech against a
model whose features were derived from Chinese ASR corpora.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
The 22-feature contract was fitted on pre-computed CTP_* columns from Chinese ASR
exports (see docs/MODEL_PROVENANCE_AUDIT.md). Several of those features are
lexical or segmentation-bound, and their population means differ *structurally*
between languages rather than because of any cognitive difference. The clearest
case is CTP_Pronouns_ratio:

  - Mandarin is a pro-drop language: subject and object pronouns are routinely
    omitted where English grammar obliges an overt pronoun.
  - The fitted training mean is 0.064 (6.4% of tokens).
  - Ordinary English conversational speech runs materially higher.

An English speaker therefore starts out looking "pronoun-heavy" before saying
anything clinically unusual, and pronoun overuse is a dementia marker in this
model. The bias is directional: it pushes English input toward Elevated Risk.
The same applies to noun/verb ratios and to every count whose denominator is a
"word", since word segmentation is not comparable across the two scripts.

THE CORRECTION
--------------
Standard mean/standard-deviation domain transfer. For a language-dependent
feature f, given a reference distribution for the speaker's OWN language
(mu_ref, sd_ref) and the training distribution (mu_train, sd_train):

    z_speaker = (value - mu_ref) / sd_ref
    value'    = mu_train + z_speaker * sd_train

This preserves the clinically meaningful quantity - how unusual this speaker is
relative to healthy speakers of their own language - while presenting the model
with a value on the scale it was fitted on. A speaker who is perfectly typical
for their language maps to the training mean and contributes nothing, instead of
contributing a spurious signal.

WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT DO
----------------------------
It will not invent reference statistics. A language is calibrated only when a
profile built from real recordings of that language exists. With no profile the
module reports `status="uncalibrated"` and changes nothing, and the caller is
expected to withhold the clinical risk tier rather than present an uncorrected
score as if it were calibrated. Build profiles with build_language_profile.py.

# Pitch variability. Acoustic, but NOT transferable, and for the same structural

# a speaker to trace rising, falling and dipping F0 contours on individual
# syllables, so pitch variability is inflated by the grammar of the language
# before any speaker-specific factor applies. The fitted training mean is
# 5.70 semitones; measured non-tonal speech in this pipeline runs near 2.4,
# roughly 1.9 SD below it.
#
# The direction of this bias is the opposite of the lexical ones: reduced pitch
# variability (monotone speech) is the dementia marker, so an uncorrected
# English or Hindi speaker looks flatter - and therefore more impaired - than
# they are. It is listed here so that it is corrected as soon as a language
# profile carrying F0 statistics exists; with no such profile the calibrator
# skips it and nothing changes.
