"""
SwarSanket asynchronous screening jobs
======================================
Turns a screening into a job instead of a request.

The free Render tier caps a request at roughly 100 seconds and gives the
container a tenth of a CPU. Whisper on a 60-second clip does not fit inside that
window, so the previous design answered HTTP 502 mid-transcription. Here the
HTTP handler only stores the audio and returns a ``recording_id``; a single
background worker then runs the pipeline and writes each stage into the
Supabase ``recordings`` row. The phone follows that row over Supabase Realtime,
or by polling ``GET /api/screenings/{recording_id}``.

Why one worker: on a tenth of a CPU two concurrent transcriptions each take
longer than the two run back-to-back, and memory is capped at 512 MB. Jobs
therefore queue, and the queue position is reported so the wait is honest.

Status vocabulary, written to ``recordings.processing_status`` and returned by
the status endpoint (the frontend switch statement depends on these exact
strings):

    queued -> uploading -> transcribing -> extracting -> scoring -> completed
                                                                  -> failed
