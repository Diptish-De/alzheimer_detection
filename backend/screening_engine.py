"""
SwarSanket Quantum-Hybrid Voice Biomarker & Screening Engine
===========================================================
Orchestrates the complete, validated ML screening pipeline:
  1. Audio decoding (PCM waveform + duration inspection via PyAV)
  2. Faster-Whisper ASR transcription with word-level timestamps
  3. spaCy linguistic analysis & Part-of-Speech (POS) ratio extraction
  4. Construction of the 22-feature Quantum-Hybrid contract vector
  5. 8-Qubit Variational Quantum Circuit inference (PyTorch + PennyLane)
  6. Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification (30 stochastic passes)
  7. Quantum feature attribution & clinical explainability

IMPORTANT:
  - Technical confidence is calculated strictly as: abs(probability - 0.5) * 2.
  - Epistemic uncertainty is quantified via Monte Carlo Dropout predictive standard deviation.
  - This is a clinical decision-support screening aid, NOT a standalone medical diagnosis.

# PROVENANCE WARNING
# ------------------
# The CTP_* features were NOT computed by this codebase. final.ipynb consumes them
# pre-computed from six CSVs (xunfei / Tencent / ALiYun ASR exports, target column
# "ad") and performs no tokenisation, IU scoring or text processing of any kind.
# Those are Chinese-language ASR corpora, so the upstream IU and keyword counting
# rules - including how a "word" is segmented - are not recoverable from any
# artifact in this repository. Everything below is a calibrated approximation whose
# only verifiable property is that it keeps inputs inside the training support. It
# is NOT a faithful reproduction of the upstream feature definitions.
#
# The IU density features are ratios whose denominator is the full transcript
# length. The reference length is recoverable from the fitted scaler statistics:
#
#   mean(CTP_num_unique_IU)       / mean(CTP_unique_IU_densitys)   = 4.6823 / 0.0559 = 83.7
#   mean(CTP_num_unique_keywords) / mean(CTP_unique_IU_efficiency) = 6.9632 / 0.0818 = 85.1
#
# A short clip divided by its own (much smaller) word count therefore inflates every
# density feature several-fold. Densities are standardised to this reference length
# instead, the same way type-token measures are reported per fixed sample size.

# mean(CTP_num_unique_IU) / mean(CTP_num_unique_keywords) = 4.6823 / 6.9632.

#
# NOTE: the training means are small in absolute terms (4.68 unique IUs, 6.96 unique
# keywords) relative to any natural English count over a transcript of the implied
# length. A fluent English description yields 20-30. The upstream counting rule is
# therefore narrower than "content words" in a way this code cannot reconstruct, so
# long descriptions still land high and are held at the boundary by the clamp below.
IU_TO_KEYWORD_RATIO = 0.6725

# Below this much speech the ratio features are dominated by sampling noise: at 28
# words, two extra pronouns move CTP_Pronouns_ratio by ~40%, which is larger than
# the effect the model is trying to detect. Short recordings get a retry prompt
