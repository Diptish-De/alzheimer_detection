## Overview

Cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease frequently manifests in subtle speech, acoustic, and linguistic alterations years prior to noticeable clinical presentation. Conventional neuropsychological assessments (e.g., MMSE, MoCA) require clinical administration, are time-intensive, and often face accessibility barriers.

**SwarSanket** provides an accessible, non-invasive voice screening system accessible across web and mobile platforms. Users describe a standardized scene (such as the Cookie Theft picture task) for 10–15 seconds. The platform analyzes acoustic stability, acoustic hesitations, linguistic density, and structural language patterns through a hybrid classical-quantum machine learning pipeline to compute calibrated screening indicators.

## Key Features

### 1. Robust Speech & Linguistic Feature Extraction
- **Faster-Whisper ASR**: Accurate speech-to-text with word-level timestamps and acoustic pause identification.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi speech patterns.
- **Acoustic Profiling**: Fundamental frequency variation ($F_0$ SD), RMS energy, hesitation ratios, phonation pause intervals (DPI, RST, EST).
- **Linguistic & Cognitive Metrics**: Part-of-speech ratios (verb count, noun ratio, pronoun proportion, noun-to-verb ratio), phrase length distributions, unique Information Unit (IU) count, IU density, and semantic communication efficiency.

### 2. Quantum-Classical Variational Architecture
- **8-Qubit Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)** built with **PennyLane** and **PyTorch**.
- **Angle Embedding**: Features are mapped into quantum states using rotational gates ($R_y$).
- **Strongly Entangling Layers**: Quantum entangling operations capture complex multi-feature interactions across acoustic and linguistic dimensions.
- **Hybrid Integration**: Classical pre-processing and post-quantum dense layers with batch normalization and dropout.

### 3. Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation
- Utilizes **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout** with 30 stochastic forward passes during inference.
- Computes mean probability, standard deviation (epistemic uncertainty), and a 95% confidence interval ($[\mu - 1.96\sigma, \mu + 1.96\sigma]$).
- Prevents overconfident predictions on noisy, short, or ambiguous audio samples.

### 4. Normalized Quantum Gradient Explainability
- Evaluates parameter-shift gradients through the 8-qubit quantum circuit to quantify feature sensitivity.
- Normalizes raw attributions into proportional impact percentages (`impact_percent`, `formatted_impact`).
- Distinguishes factors pushing toward an elevated screening signal versus those reinforcing normal baseline stability.

### 5. Multi-Platform Clients
- **Flutter Native Mobile App** (Android): Real-time microphone capture, local audio caching, dynamic LAN IP server selection, and clear clinical summaries.
- **React 19 Web App**: Responsive web interface with visual tasks, live waveform rendering, caregiver circle configuration, and printable ABHA-ready clinical summary exports.

## API Reference

### 1. Health Check
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`
- **Description**: Returns backend availability, active model type, and pipeline components.
- **Response**: `200 OK`

### 2. Asynchronous Screening Job (what the app uses)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/screenings` → `202 Accepted`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`, field `audio` (`.wav`, `.m4a`, `.webm`, `.mp3`)
- **Returns immediately** with a `recording_id`. The recording is stored in Supabase Storage and a row is inserted into the `recordings` table; a single background worker then runs the pipeline and writes each stage into that row.
- **Progress**: subscribe over Supabase Realtime to `UPDATE` events on `public.recordings` filtered by `recording_id=eq.<id>`, or poll `GET /api/screenings/{recording_id}`. Stages: `queued → uploading → transcribing → extracting → scoring → completed | failed`.
- **Why**: no HTTP request stays open longer than the upload, so a hosting proxy's request timeout (Render free tier: ~100 s) can no longer cut a screening short. One worker at a time keeps the 512 MB container inside its memory budget; the queue position is reported honestly.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/screenings \
  -F "audio=@backend/test_audio/case6_second_speaker_zira_15s.wav"
# {"success":true,"recording_id":"a1b2c3d4e5f6","status":"queued","queue_position":0,
#  "poll_url":"/api/screenings/a1b2c3d4e5f6","realtime":{"supabase_url":"…","anon_key":"…","table":"recordings",…}}

curl http://localhost:8001/api/screenings/a1b2c3d4e5f6
# {"success":true,"recording_id":"…","status":"scoring","queue_position":0,"result":null,"error":null}
# … once completed, "result" carries the same object the synchronous endpoint returns.
```

**Standardized task battery.** The same endpoint scores four short tasks that sit beside the model (`backend/task_scoring.py`); pass `task` and, where needed, a JSON `params` form field:

| `task` | Recording | Score | Flag (below typical) | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fluency` | name animals for 60 s | distinct animals | fewer than 12 | Tombaugh et al. 1999; Canning et al. 2004 |
| `recall` | say the five words heard earlier (`params.target_words`) | words recalled of 5 | 2 or fewer | MoCA delayed recall, Nasreddine et al. 2005 |
| `phonation` | hold "aaah" | maximum phonation time (s), jitter/shimmer/HNR | under 10 s, or two perturbation measures out of MDVP range | Maslan et al. 2011; Praat/MDVP thresholds |
| `daily` | "tell me about your day", 40 s | internal (episodic) details, external details, specificity | **never flagged** — no published cut-off exists for an automated detail count | Autobiographical Interview, Levine et al. 2002 |

Each result carries `scored`, `score`, `flag`, `threshold`, `reference`, `note` and `details`.

`daily` is deliberately different from the other three. It powers the **daily check-in** (`src/components/alois/AloisDailyCheckIn.tsx`), not the one-off screening, and it returns `flag: null` with `reference_type: "within_person"`. A detail count has no population cut-off, so the app reads it only against the same speaker's own earlier check-ins: the median of their first five scored days, with a band 1.5 median-absolute-deviations wide. A single low day never means anything — sleep, mood and how much actually happened that day all move it. Detail scoring is English-only; other languages are transcribed and returned unscored.

Animal lexicons for `fluency` exist for `en` (reference) and `hi`/`bn` (provisional); other languages are transcribed but left unscored, and the response says so. The app reports `fluency`, `recall` and `phonation` as "N of M in the typical range" beside the model's output and never blends them into the probability.

The `realtime` block is present only when the backend has `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set; without it the web client polls. The realtime publication is enabled by the schema (`ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.recordings`).

### 3. Synchronous Audio Screening Analysis (tests and short clips)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/analyze-audio`
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Field**: `audio` (Upload binary: `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.webm`, `.mp3`)
- **Timeout**: the whole pipeline runs inside one request. Fine locally; on a free hosting tier a 60-second clip will exceed the proxy's request cap, which is why the app uses the job endpoint above.

#### Example Request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/analyze-audio \
  -F "audio=@backend/test_audio/case6_second_speaker_zira_15s.wav"
```

#### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,

## Network Configuration for Physical Devices

When testing on physical mobile phones over local Wi-Fi:
1. Ensure the Mac/host and the phone are connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.
2. Find your host LAN IP (e.g. `10.214.104.72`):
   ```bash
   ipconfig getifaddr en0
   ```
3. The Flutter application includes an in-app **"Change Server IP"** dialog allowing you to configure `http://<YOUR_LAN_IP>:8001` dynamically.
4. Android network security configuration in `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` permits cleartext HTTP for local IP testing (`android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`).
